# Geotagged-Photo-Clustering-using-DBSCAN
This project focuses on identifying popular geographic locations by clustering geotagged photographs using the DBSCAN algorithm. By extracting GPS metadata embedded in image files through the EXIF format, the system converts raw latitude and longitude data into a structured dataset using Python libraries such as exifread, pandas, and numpy.
